Real always seem to produce good away kits, but this sleek black effort with those iconic three Adidas stripes in gold is among the best. The club's monogram on the socks is a nice touch, too.",

The lion is a nod to the team's nickname ""Les Lions de la Teranga,"" Teranga being a word used in Senegal that means hospitality, warmth and selflessness. Mane & Co. went out in the quarterfinals to Cameroon.",UAE

The Albiceleste (white and sky blue) stripes had a new Argentina crest for that tournament and, unusually, squad numbers assigned in alphabetical order. Attacking midfielder Ossie Ardiles was No. 1 and goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol took No. 7. A 21-year-old Maradona should have been No. 12 but was given his preferred No. 10, with Patricio Hernandez having to give that up.",Ubaldo Fillol

Most teams put them modestly above their badge, but when you're as confident as Juventus, why not slap giant stars on your shoulders? That's exactly what shirt makers Kappa did for two seasons from 1994 to 1996, a spell where they won four trophies, including the Champions League in 1996. That shirt, with Sony replacing Danone as shirt sponsor, and the Scudetto badge under two more little gold stars rather than the Juventus logo, was sheer perfection.",Juventus

Newcastle twice came close to winning the Premier League in this kit, and it was also their home kit at the time when Kevin Keegan had *that* outburst live on TV. He, and Newcastle, were never quite the same after that, and neither were the Magpies' kits.",Newcastle Brown Ale

Over the next decade they won seven trophies including both the UEFA Cup and Coppa Italia in 1998-99, though this marked the first time they had ever worn yellow-and-blue hoops. Their traditional home kit of white shirts with blue-and-yellow trim or a navy cross was originally influenced by Juventus. But as the Turin giants had become their Serie A rivals in the '90s, Parma made the change, as they wanted to forge their own identity.",Parma

He helped them to the Argentina title and a 3-0 win over archrivals River Plate in his first Superclasico. He did it all in this Adidas kit, with its thick yellow band, no sponsor and four stars bearing the initials ""CABJ"" (Club Atletico Boca Juniors). The club originally played in sky blue, but settled on blue and yellow in the early 20th century after taking inspiration from the Swedish flag flying on a ship docked in the Buenos Aires port of La Boca.",Maradona

ITALY (home),https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2020/0527/r702636_2_864x1296_2-3.jpg,Seasons worn: Euro 2000,"Notable players in this kit: Alessandro Del Piero (pictured), Francesco Totti, Alessandro Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro, Paolo Maldini","The '90s was a decade of near-misses and disappointments for Italy on the pitch, but it gave them some incredible kits, and that continued into the new millennium with their much-hyped Euro 2000 shirts. The Azzurri went from Nike back to Italian brand Kappa, who started the trend for slimmer-fitting shirts with these skin-tight ""Kombat"" kits. The players all wore one size up to get a comfy fit and it nearly paid off as they reached the Euro 2000 final, but lost in extra time to world champions France.",Azzurri

At the time of this kit there were no sponsors (which Barca resisted all the way into the 21st century) or even kit manufacturer logos. The only thing that seemed to change was the collar, which went from V-neck to rounded and back again. Barca didn't win much during this period, despite having the likes of Cruyff and Neeskens in their ranks, but they looked great nonetheless.",Barca

PALERMO (home),https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2020/0527/r702628_864x1296_2-3.jpg,Seasons worn: 2014-15,Notable players in this kit: Paulo Dybala (pictured),"Get ready for the most poetic colour choice of any team ever. Palermo had previously worn red-and-blue shirts, but Count Giuseppe Airoldi, a prominent founding member of the club, suggested pink and black as they are ""colours of the sad and the sweet"" and would suit a football team with ""results as up and down as a Swiss clock.""

United were on the cusp of greatness at the time having just won the FA Cup, their first trophy under Sir Alex Ferguson, and in the two years with this away kit, they won the Cup Winners' Cup, League Cup and European Super Cup.

But this one, with its black band across the chest, was so good they recommissioned this season to mark the club's 120th anniversary.

The 1994-95 season was just as good for Ajax on the pitch -- they won the Champions League, Eredivisie and Johan Cruyff Shield -- as it was for their kits.

Designed by KingRoo, each jersey was actually slightly different from the last as they weren't able to regulate the print across a range of sizes. At the time, opposition players refused to swap shirts after games, but Aussie fans have since come to love what they have dubbed the ""spew shirt"" due to its unruly brushstrokes and bright colours.

They certainly managed it with this shirt that is supposed to look like denim -- and, originally was intended to be made of denim. When the players were shown it, Lalas assumed it was a prank, later admitting: ""I'd be lying if I said people weren't looking around for the hidden camera."" And yet, the denim print (which was literally photocopied from the original design) with floating stars has since come to represent that tournament perfectly: unapologetically brash, wild and memorable.",Lalas

Maradona also scored one of the greatest solo goals ever a few minutes later. And, according to FIFA, the story behind this particular shirt also involves Maradona. Argentina coach Carlos Bilardo decided the blue cotton Aertex shirts would not be comfortable in the scorching sunshine of Mexico City. So, hours before the game, he instructed one of his coaches to head to a local sports store and buy something lighter. The coach brought back two blue kits and Maradona got to decide.
